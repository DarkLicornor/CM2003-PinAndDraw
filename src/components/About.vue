    <h2>What is Pin and Draw ?</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main idea of PinAndDraw is allowing you to pin images or text from
      others websites or applications (like Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook…), and draw or write on
       top of them. For example, you are an artist and you want to draw a landscape with 3
       pictures of reference. Using Alt-Tab to switch between each picture is a
       waste of time, and you’ll need all references and color palettes in the
       same place : your PinAndDraw board.
    </p>
    <h2>Who are we ? </h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are 3 RGU Computing students, and we love new web technologies.
      That's why this project is done with VueJS.
    </p>
    <h2>What now ? </h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our coursework is now done, and not all the functionalities have been
      implemented. In the next months, we would like to run Pin and Draw for
      real, adding new cool functionalities like drawing, rotate, change image order...
      And if you have any questions,y ou can of course contact us at 1605619@rgu.ac.uk !
